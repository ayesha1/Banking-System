# Self Servies Banking System
ðŸ’°A Banking System using Java JDBC, DB2 and JavaFx

To run this program, go to Driver.java and change the connection url, username and password.

Rename these variables to run in your Database:
public static String connectionString = "jdbc:db2://127.0.0.1:50000/SAMPLE";
public static String dbname = "db2inst1";
public static String password = "kenward";

Then go to *StartMenu.java* and run through the application. 

This is a database application which acts like a simple banking system.
This project is implemented using DB2, Java, and JDBC. For the GUI it uses JavaFx

The implementation is also recorded on https://youtu.be/P4ePMCL0mXo

You have to have JavaFX in the library and running on the latest eclipse ( version 8). Please email me if you have any trouble downloading! I am more than happy to help. ayeshakay786@gmail.com
